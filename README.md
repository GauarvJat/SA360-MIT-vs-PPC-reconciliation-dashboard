PPC Dashboard QA Automation

Overview

This project automates the quality assurance (QA) process for validating media performance data between source advertising platforms and a centralized reporting dashboard.
The solution compares platform-reported metrics from Search, Social, and Video channels against data available in the reporting dashboard and identifies discrepancies for investigation and resolution.
Business Problem

Media reporting dashboards are often populated using multiple data pipelines and transformation processes. Manual validation of dashboard data against source platforms is time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to human error.
The objective of this project was to automate the validation process and provide a reliable mechanism to identify data mismatches quickly.
Solution

A combination of Python, VBA, Excel, SQL, and Power BI was used to:

•	Extract and process media platform reports.

•	Retrieve reporting data from Databricks SQL.

•	Compare source platform metrics with dashboard metrics.

•	Identify discrepancies based on predefined validation rules.

•	Generate reports for investigation and stakeholder review.

•	Visualize QA results through interactive Power BI dashboards.


Data Sources Media Platforms

•	SA360

•	YouTube

•	Facebook


Reporting Source

•	Databricks SQL

Validation Process
1.	Download reports from media platforms.
2.	Import platform data into the validation framework.
3.	Retrieve corresponding dashboard data.
4.	Standardize dimensions and metrics.
5.	Perform automated comparisons.
6.	Flag variances exceeding acceptable thresholds.
7.	Publish QA summary through Power BI.
8.	Share findings with Project Managers and Data Engineering teams.
